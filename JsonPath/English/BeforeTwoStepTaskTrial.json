      "text": "The purpose of this task is to learn which images are associated with which rewards. The task has 2 levels, which are marked by different colors. In each round you start at level 1. There you have the choice between two pictures. Your choice decides which stage (red or blue) you get to in level 2. In the example below, choosing the left image mostly (7 times out of 10) leads to the red stage and only sometimes (3 times out of 10) to the blue one. On the other hand, choosing the right image mostly (in 7 out of 10 cases) leads to the blue stage and only sometimes to the red one (in 3 out of 10 cases). You have to figure out which image in level 1 leads to which stage in level 2."

      "text": "In the second level, you again have to choose between two images. Each of the images in level 2 is associated with a certain reward in the form of points. The reward values can change slowly over the course of the task. Your task is to earn as many points as possible. Press the arrow keys to select the image you think will yield the highest reward. In the following example the left image was rewarded with 13 points and the right image with 73 points."

      "text": "After you have received a reward in the 2nd level, you will be returned back to level 1 and a new round will begin. Remember, each image in level 1 leads to a certain level 2 in 70% of the cases. This probability does not change and it is your task to find out which picture leads to which 2nd level. In contrast, in level 2 the reward levels change slowly. Try to keep track of which image in level 2 is highly rewarded at a certain point in the experiment.So try to earn as many points as possible. The pictures in the trial round are different than in the exercise, but the task is the same as before in the exercise. To start with the sample tasks, click on \"Start\"."
