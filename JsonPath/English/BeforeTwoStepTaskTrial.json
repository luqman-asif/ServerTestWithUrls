      "text": "The purpose of this task is to learn which images are associated with which rewards. The task has 2 levels, which are marked by different colors. In each round you start at level 1. There you have the choice between two pictures. Your choice decides which stage (red or blue) you get to in level 2. In the example below, choosing the left image mostly (7 times out of 10) leads to the red stage and only sometimes (3 times out of 10) to the blue one. On the other hand, choosing the right image mostly (in 7 out of 10 cases) leads to the blue stage and only sometimes to the red one (in 3 out of 10 cases). You have to figure out which image in level 1 leads to which stage in level 2."

The reward values can change slowly over the course of the task. Your task is to earn as many points as possible. Press the arrow keys to select the image you think will yield the highest reward. In the following example the left image was rewarded with 13 points and the right image with 73 points."

Remember, each image in level 1 leads to one specific stage in level 2 in 70% of the cases. T his probability does not change over time and it is your task to find out which picture leads to which stage in the 2nd level. In contrast, in level 2 the reward points of each picture change slowly over time. Try to keep track of which image in level 2 is the most rewarding to earn as much points as possible. For each choice you have 2 seconds to respond. To start with a few practice rounds please click on \"Start\"."
